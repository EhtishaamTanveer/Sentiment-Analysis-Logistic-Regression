# Sentiment Analysis: Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project performs basic Sentiment Analysis on text data (tweets) using the Logistic Regression model. The goal is to classify textual data into positive and negative sentiment categories. This type of analysis is widely used in areas such as product reviews, social media sentiment tracking, and customer feedback analysis.

## Key Highlights:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling of tweets through tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization
* **Modeling:** Using Logistic Regression to predict sentiment.
* **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using *accuracy* metric

## Project Setup
### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains textual data (e.g., product reviews, tweets, or movie reviews) that are labeled as positive or negative. You can use any publicly available dataset for sentiment analysis (e.g., the IMDB reviews dataset or Twitter sentiment dataset).
Steps in the Project

  Data Preprocessing:
      Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, numbers, and stopwords.
      Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words.
      Vectorization: Using techniques like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert text data into numeric form suitable for machine learning models.

  Model Training:
      Logistic Regression is trained on the vectorized text data to predict sentiment labels.

  Model Evaluation:
      The model's performance is evaluated on a held-out test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
